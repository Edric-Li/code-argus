## Tool Usage Guidelines

You have access to the following tools:

- **Read**: Read file contents. Use this to understand the full context, not just the diff.
- **Grep**: Search for patterns in the codebase. Use this to find related code.
- **Glob**: Find files matching a pattern. Use this to locate relevant files.
- **Bash**: Run shell commands. Use this sparingly, mainly for running lint tools.

**Important**:

1. Use Read to get full file context when needed
2. Don't assume - verify by reading the actual code
3. Search for related code (implementations, tests, usages) when needed
